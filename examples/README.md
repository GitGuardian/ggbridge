# GGBridge Use Cases

This page details the main use cases covered by **GGBridge**.

It provides an overview of the different scenarios in which GGBridge can be used, including how it facilitates secure and seamless connections between on-premises VCS and the GitGuardian platform. Each use case is documented with key considerations and implementation details to help users understand and deploy GGBridge effectively.

ðŸ’¡ Feel free to explore the different use cases and adapt the configurations to your needs, you can refer to the [Helm Chart documentation](../helm/ggbridge/README.md).

## Connect your VCS to your Self-Hosted instance

You have deployed a **Self-Hosted GitGuardian** instance on a network completely isolated from the internet, yet you still want it to access a public VCS and allow the VCS to communicate with your instanceâ€”for example, to enable real-time scanning.

### Deploy the GGBridge server

Configure the following values:

```yaml
hostname: <ggbridge-server-hostname>

tls:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: ggbridge-server-crt
  existingSecretKeys:
    caCrt: ca.crt
    crt: tls.crt
    key: tls.key

server:
  # -- Expose the GGBridge Server endpoint using ingress
  ingress:
    enabled: true

proxy:
  tunnels:
    web:
      # -- Expose the web tunnel using ingress
      ingress:
        enabled: true
        listeners:
          # -- Configure a listener for hook.custom.com and rewrite-redirect to hook.gitguardian.com
          - hostname: hook.custom.com
            backend: hook.gitguardian.com
            tls:
              # -- Sepcify the TLS secret name containing the certificate for hook.custom.com
              secretName: g9n-crt
```

### Deploy the GGBridge client

Configure the following values:

```yaml
hostname: <ggbridge-server-hostname>

tls:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: ggbridge-client-crt
  existingSecretKeys:
    caCrt: ca.crt
    crt: tls.crt
    key: tls.key

client:
  reverseTunnels:
    web:
        # -- Enable web reverse tunnel
      enabled: true
```
