# Enabling 2-Way Tunneling

By default, the `ggbridge` client does not expose any **client â†’ server** proxies that allow accessing remote resources through the established tunnel.

However, `ggbridge` supports client-to-server proxy with **TLS Routing**.

**TLS Routing** exposes a TLS port to forward all incoming TLS traffic through a TCP tunnel. This requires **DNS redirection**, e.g., redirecting `hook.gitguardian.com` requests to the ggbridge client.

> [!CAUTION]  
> On the server side, only requests to `hook.gitguardian.com` and `api.gitguardian.com` are allowed for client â†’ server traffic.

## TLS Routing

![tls-routing](../../docs/images/ggbridge-tls-routing.drawio.png)

To enable **TLS Routing**, update your Helm values as follows:

```yaml
client:
  tunnels:
    tls:
      enabled: true
```

> [!NOTE]  
> **TLS Routing** does not work natively with standard `Ingress` objects. Some Ingress controllers offer specific configurations (annotations, custom parameters, etc.) to enable TLS Routing with `Ingress`, but this depends entirely on your controllerâ€™s capabilities and is highly implementation-specific. Please refer to your Ingress controllerâ€™s documentation for this particular use case.

The TLS port can be exposed using one of the following methods:

### 1. LoadBalancer Service

Helm values file example ðŸ‘‰ [values-tls-service.yaml](./helm/values-tls-service.yaml)

```yaml
proxy:
  tunnels:
    tls:
      service:
        type: LoadBalancer
        ports:
          tls:
            port: 443
```
Ensure that your VCS (and any assets using the GitGuardian hook) resolve `hook.gitguardian.com` and `api.gitguardian.com` to the external IP address of the created LoadBalancer Service (default name `ggbridge-proxy-tls`).

> [!NOTE]  
> `LoadBalancer` Service exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. Kubernetes does not directly offer a load balancing component; you must provide one, or you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider. Refer to official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) for more information.

### 2. Custom Resource (CRD)

Some Ingress controllers provide Custom Resources that enable enhanced capabilitiesâ€”such as TCP handling, authentication, and other advanced features. This is the case with Traefik, Istio, and other well-known Kubernetes networking solutions.

Currently we support Traefik [`IngressRouteTCP`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/routing-configuration/kubernetes/crd/tcp/ingressroutetcp/) Custom Resource. Ensure that Traefik ingress controller is installed in your cluster first.

Helm values file example ðŸ‘‰ [values-tls-traefik.yaml](./helm/values-tls-traefik.yaml)

```yaml
proxy:
  tunnels:
    tls:
      ingress:
        enabled: true
        controller: "traefik"
```

Ensure that your VCS (and any assets using the GitGuardian hook) resolve `hook.gitguardian.com` and `api.gitguardian.com` to the external IP address of the Traefik LoadBalancer Service.
```console
$ kubectl get service -n traefik
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
traefik          LoadBalancer   10.43.65.162   172.31.26.173   80:20572/TCP,443:27014/TCP   29h
```

### 3. Gateway API

> [!NOTE]  
> [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#getting-started-with-gateway-api) must be installed in your cluster first.

Helm values file example ðŸ‘‰ [values-tls-gateway.yaml](./helm/values-tls-gateway.yaml)

```yaml
proxy:
  tunnels:
    tls:
      gateway:
        enabled: true
        gateway:
          # This will create the gateway resource, you can disable it if you want to manage it on your own.
          create: true
          # This will set the gatewayClass of the Gateway
          className: "my-gatewayclass"
```

This will create a [`Gateway`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gateway) and [`TLSRoute`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#tlsroute) object. You need to deploy first a [`GatewayClass`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gatewayclass) in your cluster.

If your teams already manage `GatewayClass` and `Gateway` resources, you can reference the `Gateway` in the `TLSRoute` with :
```yaml
proxy:
  tunnels:
    tls:
      gateway:
        enabled: true
        parentRefs:
        - name: my-gateway
          namespace: my-gateway-namespace
        gateway:
          create: false
```

Ensure that your VCS (and any assets using the GitGuardian hook) resolve `hook.gitguardian.com` and `api.gitguardian.com` to the IP address of the `Gateway` Custom Resource.
```console
$ kubectl get gateway
NAME             CLASS             ADDRESS         PROGRAMMED    AGE
my-gateway       my-gatewayclass   192.168.1.200   True          54h
```

### 4. OpenShift Route

Helm values file example ðŸ‘‰ [values-tls-openshift-route.yaml](./helm/values-tls-openshift-route.yaml)

```yaml
proxy:
  resolver: dns-default.openshift-dns.svc.cluster.local
  tunnels:
    tls:
      openShiftRoute:
        enabled: true
```

With these configurations, your ggbridge client can securely forward traffic through the tunnel from the client side to approved GitGuardian services.
